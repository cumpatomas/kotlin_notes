As you already know, an exception interrupts normal execution of a program. Normally, this is not what we want to happen. Good news is, it is possible to write code that will handle exceptions without stopping the whole program.

To do that, Kotlin has the exception handling mechanism. After a line of code throws an exception, Kotlin attempts to find a suitable handler for it. Such a handler can be located in the same method where the exception occurred or in the calling method. As soon as a suitable handler is found and executed, the exception is considered handled and the program runs normally.

In this topic, we will learn about two keywords for handling exceptions: try and catch.

## The try-catch statement
Here is a simple try-catch template for handling exceptions:

```kotlin
try {
// code that may throw an exception
} catch (e: SomeException) {
// code for handling the exception
}
```
The try block is used to wrap the code that may throw an exception. This block can include all lines of code, including method calls.

The catch block is a handler for the specified type of exception and all its subtypes. This block is executed when an exception of the corresponding type occurs in the try block.

Note that the specified type in the catch block must be an exception.
In the presented template, the catch block can handle exceptions of the Exception type and all types derived from it.

The following example demonstrates the execution flow with try and catch:

```kotlin
println("Before the try-catch block") // it will be printed
try {
println("Inside the try block before an exception") // it will be printed
println(2 / 0) // it throws ArithmeticException
println("Inside the try block after the exception") // it won't be printed
}
catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
println("Division by zero!") // it will be printed
}

println("After the try-catch block") // it will be printed
```
The output:

```kotlin
Before the try-catch block
Inside the try block before an exception
Division by zero!
After the try-catch block
```
The program does not print "Inside the try block after the exception" since the ArithmeticException aborted the normal flow of execution. Instead, it executes the print statement in the catch block. After the completion of the catch block, the program executes the next statement (printing "After the try-catch block") without returning to the try block again.

Replacing Exception with ArithmeticException or RuntimeException in the catch statement does not change the execution flow of the program. But replacing it, for instance, with NumberFormatException will make the handler unsuitable for the exception and the program will fail.

Pay attention! The variables announced in the try block will only be available in the block: you can't work with it neither outside nor in the catch block.

If the result of the execution of the try block throws an exception not foreseen in the catch expression, the program will fail despite all precautions.
### Getting info about exceptions
When an exception is caught by the catch block, it is possible to get some information on it. To do this, we use message:

```kotlin
try {
val d = (2 / 0).toDouble()
}
catch (e: Exception) {
println(e.message)
}
```
This code prints:

`/ by zero`
### Catching multiple exceptions
It is always possible to use a single handler for all types of exceptions:

```kotlin
try {
// code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (e: Exception) {
println("Something goes wrong")
}
Obviously, this approach does not allow us to perform different actions depending on the type of exception that has occurred. Fortunately, Kotlin supports the use of several handlers inside the same try block:

try {
// code that throws exceptions
}
catch (e: IOException) {
// handling the IOException and its subtypes   
}
catch (e: Exception) {
// handling the Exception and its subtypes
}
```
You can add as many catch blocks as you need. When an exception occurs in the try block, the runtime system determines the first suitable catch block according to the type of the exception; matching goes from top to down.

The catch block with the base type has to be written below all the blocks with subtypes. In other words, more specialized handlers (like IOException) must be written before the more general ones (like Exception). Otherwise, the block with the subtype will be ignored.
### Where and how to handle an exception
Technically, an exception can be handled in the method where it occurs or in the calling method. The best approach to handle an exception is to do it in a method that has sufficient information to make the correct decision based on this exception.

So, why should we throw out specific types of exceptions when there is a general Exception that includes all possible cases and is always appropriate? Well, keep in mind that your colleagues or maybe even yourself in a couple of weeks may not really know whatâ€™s going on in the code. It would be best for you to provide as much information as possible. This will make handling exceptions much easier.

Always try to find the exception type that fits best to your exceptional event, for instance, throw a NumberFormatException instead of just an Exception.
